**The Zen of Python**    

Beautiful is better than ugly. 

Explicit is better than implicit. 

Simple is better than complex. 

Complex is better than complicated. 

Flat is better than nested. 

Sparse is better than dense.

 Readability counts. Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.

 Although practicality beats purity. Errors should never pass silently. Unless explicitly silenced. 

In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess. There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it. Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch. 

Now is better than never. 

Although never is often better than *right* now. If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea. If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea. 

Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those! 



美丽胜过丑陋。

 显式比隐式更好。

 简单胜于复杂。 

复杂比复杂好。 

平面比嵌套更好。

 稀疏比密集好。 

可读性计数。 

特例不足以打破规则。

 虽然实用性胜过纯净。 错误不应该默默通过。 除非明确沉默。 

面对歧义，拒绝猜测的诱惑。 应该有一个 - 最好只有一个 - 明显的方法来做到这一点。尽管这种方式一开始可能并不明显，除非你是荷兰人。

 现在比从未好。 虽然从来没有比现在好的*好。

 如果实施很难解释，这是一个坏主意。 如果实施很容易解释，这可能是一个好主意。 

命名空间是一个好主意 - 让我们做更多的！
